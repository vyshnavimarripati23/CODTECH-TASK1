OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT:

Project: EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS

Objective Of The Project:
The main purpose of EDA is to help look at data before making any assumptions.
It can help identify obvious errors, as well as better understand patterns within the data, 
detect outliers or anomalous events, find interesting relations among the variables.

Technologies Used:python

Description:
Specific statistical functions and techniques you can perform with EDA tools include:

Clustering and dimension reduction techniques, which help create graphical displays of high-dimensional data containing many variables.
Univariate visualization of each field in the raw dataset, with summary statistics.
Bivariate visualizations and summary statistics that allow you to assess the relationship between each variable in the dataset and the target variable you’re looking at.
Multivariate visualizations, for mapping and understanding interactions between different fields in the data.
K-means Clustering is a clustering method in unsupervised learning where data points are assigned into K groups, i.e. the number of clusters, based on the distance from each group’s centroid. The data points closest to a particular centroid will be clustered under the same category. K-means Clustering is commonly used in market segmentation, pattern recognition, and image compression.
Predictive models, such as linear regression, use statistics and data to predict outcomes.
